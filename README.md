### Why?

This Android app is made as a exam project in a Android/iOS elective.

It is an app for collectors of amber, where they can share spots where they have found amber.
The inspiration for this idea comes from my little brother, who collects amber and mentioned that he and like minded people wanted such an app (and [webapp](https://github.com/lucaryholt/ambrScope_node)).

### Technology

The app is written in Java.

It uses **Google Firebase** elements such as **Firestore** and **Authentication**. A benefit of this is that the app has live updates of these spots and easy synchronization with its [Node.JS companion webapp](https://github.com/lucaryholt/ambrScope_node).

### Running the app

To run the app, you need to have a **Firebase** project and follow the instructions in the **Firebase** documentation. You also need a **Google Maps** API key and follow those instructions.
You can then build the app and install it on your device.

Alternatively, I will possibly at some point upload an *APK* installation file, which can then be downloaded and installed.
